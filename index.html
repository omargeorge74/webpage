        </header>  <!--second piece of information and a class for the paragraph -->
        <p class="paragraph">What got me into becoming a programmer and joining the Thinkful family was seeing the success my best friend was having as a programmer made me realize that I can have the same success for myself and my family. My past experience was nothing like coding it was hard manual labor, but my love for problem solving made it easier to change into programing. I am a person that loves to work as a team it comes from my time as being a high school athlete.<br>

        One of my favorite interest is anime I love anime I have been watching and reading the manga since middle school. My current favorite anime is solo leveling. </p>
